# Hackathon_Rose_Spiders

Welcome to the Hackathon_Rose_Spiders project! This is a React application developed during a hackathon event. The Hackathon_Rose_Spiders project implements a microaggression detection system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text inputs. This system identifies potential microaggressions, visualizes the words contributing to negative sentiment, and provides detailed feedback on identified categories.
